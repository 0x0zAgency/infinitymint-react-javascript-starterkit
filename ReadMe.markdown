## ðŸ—¿ Installation

`npm i infinitymint`

InfinityMint also provides a working [_Nix_](https://nixos.org) setup out of the box for development.
This is to prevent conflicts in environment between the end developer & shipping to production.

Access to the environment is provided via a _Nix Flake._ To enter;
`nix develop`

InfinityMint works with both Javascript and Typescript and can be used in both the browser and in node.

## ðŸ—¿ Setup

You will need to create a new file in the current working directory (the one with your package.json) or the node project called `hardhat.config.js` or `hardhat.config.ts`, depending on if you are using InfinityMint in a TypeScript or Javascript environment.

Please either download the configuration file and place it in your node projects root or copy the following contents into your hardhat configuration file. If you are bringing InfinityMint into an already established hardhat project. Then simply backup the contents of your current hardhat configuration file as you will be able to place it into InfinityMint's configuration file instead.

[Link to hardhat.config.ts (for ts)](https://github.com/0x0zAgency/infinitymint-beta/blob/master/examples/hardhat.config.ts)

[Link to hardhat.config.js (for js)](https://github.com/0x0zAgency/infinitymint-beta/blob/master/examples/js/hardhat.config.js)

InfinityMint will automatically create a `infinitymint.config.ts` or `infinitymint.config.js` depending on the environment. This new project file which is created is where you configure both hardhat and InfinityMint and other things which can be installed into InfinityMint.

Please view our official documentation and [examples](https://docs.infinitymint.app/modules/examples_examples.html) for more information.

### ðŸš¨ **READ HERE IN CASE OF ERRORS**

-   `Error: error:0308010C:digital envelope routines::unsupported`

This is a **known** issue with some node versions < 16.
The workaround is to simply pass the `--openssl-legacy-provider` flag into your `npm run start`.

## ðŸ—¿ Usage

InfinityMint can work via npx and any of the InfinityMint scripts (including gems) can be executed through the terminal. Simply run `npx infinitymint` to see a list of available commands.

You can do every action inside of InfinityMint through the npx command module.

`npx infinitymint compile --project "maskmode"`

`npx infinitymint deploy --project "maskmode" --network "ganache"`

### ðŸ—¿ Usage (if you are working on this repository)

To run commands inside of this repository all you need to do is run the following command in replacement to npx infinitymint.

`ts-node run.ts`

### Terminology

The terminology used by InfinityMint can easily get overwhelming and complex to new users.
To simplify the process of understanding, there are only a handful of concepts to remember that will be listed here:

-   **[Project](#project)**

-   **[Token](#token)**

-   **[TokenURI](#tokenuri)**

-   **[Path](#path)**

#### Project

Projects in InfinityMint are a _global_ configuration for how your project handles the display, functionality and content of your `Token`s.
Editing the project should **always** be done by creating a temporary copy of the project file, and working upon that copy. This aids in rolling back versions, correcting previous mistakes etc without having to constantly redeploy projects on chain.

#### Path

A path is a subset/branch of the `Project` which is a variation of a `token`, otherwise known as a mint. You can configure it to hold functionality such as becoming a _receiver_ for solidity contracts, place other `ERC721`s inside the content of the `paths`, and hold data such as images, text, hyperlinks configured through these `paths`.
Paths always start at **one**. A path with `pathId 0` will simply return no path.

#### Token

A token is your own `ERC721` contained with a `path`. They are held within your project configuration, and uploaded to chain through InfinityMint.

#### TokenURI

TokenURIs are links to ERC721 token receivers that get linked on chain. This comes from the [standard ERC721 spec](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/2.x/api/token/erc721)
A token owner must point to where the contract and its data exists on chain, which is done via the `InfinityMintLinker`.
