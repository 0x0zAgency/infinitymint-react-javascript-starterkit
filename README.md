# InfinityMintWeb Omega

InfinityMint is an NFT minter minter which allows you to create many different types of NFT projects. It supports images, vectors and technically all types of content. InfinityMint allows you to easily deploy to Rinkeby, Ethereum, Polygon, Mumbai and any other smart
contract supporting chain. InfinityMint also allows you to easily test
your mints by wrapping over technologies such as Hardhat, Ganache and Ethers to deliver a easy WYSISG test driven development system that allows anyone to get into web3. Its a simple as `yarn start` to instantly deploy InfinityMint to ganache and test locally.

InfinityMint also comes packed with many web3 innovations, any NFT minted by InfinityMint is instantly monetizable through the Ethereum Ad Service sticker system. A system which allows users to pay for their own content to be presented on the NFT. InfinityMint comes packed with on-chain Marketplace functionality through the deployment of an extension contract. InfinityMint Omega supports the idea of extensions and snapping on future functionality to your smart contract rather than typical proxy based web3 architecture. InfinityMint also comes packed with royalty controllers already included, through the InfinityMint project file you are able to specify percentage cuts out of all the profit revenues that InfinityMint brings in. For instance, if your team was an artist and a developer you could set InfinityMint to split the profits 50/50 to each address. No negotiation has to occur between any team members post deployment as they all at any time individually can hit up InfinityMint and withdraw their profits.

Combined with the web component, InfinityMint allows you to get your web3 idea going up in minutes, not months. It supports all operating systems and the web component supports mobiles, tablets and desktops and is built upon React using the Bootstrap 5 react component framework. InfinityMint is completely decentralized and requires no web2 services to work out of the box. However features such as your token gallery and automatic tokenURI set will be unavailable without an InfinityMint api key. You will also see slower speeds without an api key as all assets for your token will be pulled through a public IPFS node. You will need to obtain an API key directly from InfinityMint which is free up to your 1000th token minted.

We are currently still very early in development so please report any bugs as an issue on this repository and we shall look into it as soon as possible.
